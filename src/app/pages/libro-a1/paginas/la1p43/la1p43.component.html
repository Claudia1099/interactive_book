            <p class="justify">It was Nicky’s idea, but we all think it’s going to be brilliant. As soon as the last exams have finished, we’re going to decorate the main hall at school with paper streamers and Chinese lanterns and things. Steve had this idea of projecting
                photos of everyone onto a wall, like a slide show. And we’ve got Jo’s brother, who’s a professional DJ, coming along. Then there are three different bands lined up to play. Ours is the best, because we’ve been together longest and we’ve
                got a great bass player, (coughs) although I say so myself, so we’re on last. It’s going to be cool.</p>

            <p class="justify">Every year there’s a carnival in August in London. You’ve probably heard of it, the Notting Hill Carnival? So this year, me and my friends are going again. We went last year and we had such a fantastic time. It’s all Afro-Caribbean, with people
                in amazing costumes and these brilliant steel bands. We don’t go in costume, but we do dance a lot. It does get quite crowded, so you have to make sure you stick together. And you have to watch out for pick-pockets when there are so many
                people in the same place. But it’s really good fun; it’s like London becomes a different country. Even the police dance sometimes.</p>

            <p class="justify">We’re going to hire a boat for the day and take it up the river. It’s my grandparents’ golden wedding anniversary, so the whole family is getting together. I’m really looking forward to seeing my cousins again. I haven’t seen them for ages.
                We’ve got this huge picnic planned, with loads of different types of sandwiches and salads and an enormous cake. My dad has borrowed an ancient gramophone player, you know, what they had before CD players, and some old records. So as we
                go up the river we’re going to listen to music from the time my grandparents got married – the swinging sixties!</p>
