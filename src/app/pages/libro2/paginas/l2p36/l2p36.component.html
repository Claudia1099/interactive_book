        Many people are sitting in the reception room at the Ace Employment
        service. They’re all looking for work, and they’re hoping they can find
        jobs today. Natalie is looking for a job as a secretary. She can type,
        she can file, and she can use business software on the computer. William
        is looking for a job as a building superintendent. He can paint walls,
        he can repair locks, and he can fix stoves and refrigerators.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Sandra is looking for a job as a construction worker. She can use tools,
        she can operate equipment, and she can build things. Nick is looking for
        a job as a salesperson. He can talk to customers, he can use a cash
        register, and he can take inventory. Stephanie and Tiffany are looking
        for jobs as actresses. They can sing. They can dance, and they can act.
        Good luck, everybody! We hope you find the jobs you’re looking for!
