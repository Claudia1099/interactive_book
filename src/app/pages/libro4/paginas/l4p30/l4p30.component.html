      <h4 class="my-2 text-center">THE WILSONS' PARTY</h4>
      <p class="justify">
        Mr. and Mrs. Wilson invited all their friends and neighbours to a party
        last night. They stayed home all day yesterday and prepared for the
        party.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        In the morning the Wilson’s worked outside. Their daughter, Margaret,
        cleaned the yard. Their son, Bob, painted the fence. Mrs. Wilson planted
        flowers in the garden, and Mr. Wilson fixed their broken front steps.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        In the afternoon the Wilson’s worked inside the house. Margaret washed
        the floors and vacuumed the living room carpet. Bob dusted the furniture
        and cleaned the basement. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson stayed in the kitchen all
        afternoon. He cooked spaghetti for dinner, and she baked apple pies for
        dessert.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        The Wilson’s finished all their work at six o'clock. Their house looked
        beautiful inside and out!<br />
        The Wilson’s' guests arrived at about 7:30. After they arrived, they all
        sat in the living room. They ate cheese and crackers, drank lemonade,
        and talked. Some people talked about their children. Other people talked
        about the weather. And everyboy talked about how beautiful the Wilson’s'
        house looked inside and out!
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        The Wilson’s served dinner in the dining room at 9:00. Everybody enjoyed
        the meal very much. They liked Mr. Wilson's spaghetti and they "loved"
        Mrs. Wilson's apple pie. In fact, everybody asked for seconds.<br />
        After dinner everybody sat in the living room again. First, Bob Wilson
        played the piano and his sister, Margaret, sang. Then, Mr. and Mrs.
        Wilson showed a video of their trip to Hawaii. After that, they turned
        on the music and everybody danced.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        As you can see, the Wilson’s' guests enjoyed the party very much. In
        fact, nobody wanted to go home!
