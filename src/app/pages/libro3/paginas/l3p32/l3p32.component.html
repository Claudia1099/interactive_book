        People are buying things in new ways these days. Many people are busy,
        and they don't want to go to crowded stores. They shop from mail-order
        catalogues (books with pictures of things to buy). Tired shoppers in
        some cities can even buy groceries (things in a supermarket) by phone!
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Most people are shopping differently Â¡n stores too. They are taking
        groceries home in a different way. People in the supermarket ask,
        "Plastic or paper?" Many people like plastic bags, but plastic is
        terrible for the environment (the air, land, and water around us). Paper
        bags also are bad because we use too many trees to make them.Only five
        hundred bags come from each tree. Some people understand this. They
        aren't using plastic or paper bags. They're taking cloth bags to the
        store. These cloth bags are reusable. (People can use them again and
        again for many years.) The bags are washable too. (People can wash
        them.)
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Today many people are thinking about the environment. They want to have
        a safe world for their children. People are changing to different
        products (things in a store). Some mail-order companies are now selling
        special products too. Cloth shopping bags, cloth diapers (for babies to
        wear), and soap without chemicals help the environment. The mail-order
        companies help the environment and make a lot of money!
