            <p class="justify">People are buying things in new ways these days. Many people are busy, and they don't want to go to crowded stores. They shop from mail-order catalogues (books with pictures of things to buy). Tired shoppers in some cities can even buy groceries
                (things in a supermarket) by phone!</p>
            <p class="justify">Most people are shopping differently Â¡n stores too. They are taking groceries home in a different way. People in the supermarket ask, "Plastic or paper?" Many people like plastic bags, but plastic is terrible for the environment (the air,
                land, and water around us). Paper bags also are bad because we use too many trees to make them.Only five hundred bags come from each tree. Some people understand this. They aren't using plastic or paper bags. They're taking cloth bags
                to the store. These cloth bags are reusable. (People can use them again and again for many years.) The bags are washable too. (People can wash them.)</p>
            <p class="justify">Today many people are thinking about the environment. They want to have a safe world for their children. People are changing to different products (things in a store). Some mail-order companies are now selling special products too. Cloth shopping
                bags, cloth diapers (for babies to wear), and soap without chemicals help the environment. The mail-order companies help the environment and make a lot of money!</p>
