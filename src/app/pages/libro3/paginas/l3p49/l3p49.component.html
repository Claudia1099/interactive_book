        Begin the activity by asking the students what they like and dislike
        about staying in hotels.<br />
        Next, divide the class into groups of three. Read through the hotel
        introduction and instructions on.<br />
        Students have taken over the management of a hotel and they are going to
        decide what rules to have in the hotel for guests and staff.<br />
        Write the rules in the second column using modal verbs of obligation and
        prohibition.<br />
        Groups should also think of extra rules for guests and staff and write
        them in the 'Other rules' box. <br />
        When the students have finished writing, have each group join with
        another group and compare rules, taking note of rules which are the same
        and different.<br />
        If one group doesnâ€™t agree with another group's rule, they try to
        persuade the other group to change it.<br />
        Finally, the groups explain their rules to the class. Discuss any
        unusual rules and see if the class can agree on one set of rules for the
        hotel.<br /><!-- audio 136-->

        The Modal Hotel features two outdoor pools in beautifully landscaped
        grounds. It also has a spa and two restaurants. It is a five-minute walk
        from the night market and city center.<br />
        Your group has just taken over management of the hotel. Look at the
        following information and decide what rules you are going to have in the
        hotel. Use modal verbs of obligation and prohibition to create the
        rules.
