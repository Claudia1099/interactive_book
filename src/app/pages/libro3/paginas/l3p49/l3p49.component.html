            </h5>
            <p class="justify">Begin the activity by asking the students what they like and dislike about staying in hotels.<br> Next, divide the class into groups of three. Read through the hotel introduction and instructions on.<br> Students have taken over the management
                of a hotel and they are going to decide what rules to have in the hotel for guests and staff.<br> Write the rules in the second column using modal verbs of obligation and prohibition.<br> Groups should also think of extra rules for guests
                and staff and write them in the 'Other rules' box.
                <br> When the students have finished writing, have each group join with another group and compare rules, taking note of rules which are the same and different.<br> If one group doesnâ€™t agree with another group's rule, they try to persuade
                the other group to change it.<br> Finally, the groups explain their rules to the class. Discuss any unusual rules and see if the class can agree on one set of rules for the hotel.<br> The Modal Hotel features two outdoor pools in beautifully
                landscaped grounds. It also has a spa and two restaurants. It is a five-minute walk from the night market and city center.<br> Your group has just taken over management of the hotel. Look at the following information and decide what rules
                you are going to have in the hotel. Use modal verbs of obligation and prohibition to create the rules.</p>
